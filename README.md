# Dayelis-Bot
This is the bot maintained by me for personal use in my TTRPG group with my close friends. This bot's purpose is to make scheduling a bit easier, and have some tools available for different TTRPG based activities.

## Current functions:  
!pf2e to pull up Archives of Nethys link for Pathfinder 2E  
!sf2e to pull up Archievs of Netyhs link for Starfinder 2E  
!foundry to pull up ThatOneSongbird's Foundry  
!hello to get a random greeting.  
!announcement to send an embedded announcement. Dayelis will prompt the user for the information, and reiterate a loop for every new field (up to 25)
!reloadcog <cog name> to reload a cog for new functionality
